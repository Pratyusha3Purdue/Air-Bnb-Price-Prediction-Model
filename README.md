# Decoding COVID-19's Impact on AirBnb Price Patterns using Predictive Analytics

## Problem Statement: To Unvcoer the impacts of Covid-19 Airbnb

### Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes AirBnb data from two cities, New York and Seatlle. The data is from 2010 till 2024, Covering the timeperiod before during and after Covid.

### Methodology:

1. Cleaning the data:
  • We removed the $ symbol and any commas to make price a float data type and easy to make calculations on.
  • Dropped un-necessary columns like bedrooms for ease of working
  • Remove extreme outliers
  • Classified the data entries as Before , During Covid or After based on: 
      if they were recorded before Dec 2019 : Before || between Dec 2019 and Dec 2021 : During Covid || after 2021 : After

3. EDA:
  • To find the number of Unique hosts and Unique listings 
  • Listings Count by Room Type and Property type
  • Plot categorical variables and numerical variables
  • Visualized relationships between prices and key features: room type, property type, number of beds, and accommodates
  • Plotted price trends over time, focusing on the COVID-19 periods.
  • Analyzed review comments of the 1,000 most expensive listings to find commonly used terms.

4. Data Pre-Processing:
  • Handled missing values
  • Convert categorical variables to numerical using Label Encoding
  • Split the data into features and target
  • Split the data into training and testing sets (70-30 split)
6. Model Building:
 • Used LightGBM for model training and prediction.
 • Performed cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
 • Tuned hyperparameters using grid search.
 • Predicted Prices
 • Evaluated feature importance to understand the key drivers of price changes.
 7. Evaluate reults:
 • Compared actual vs. predicted prices on both training and test datasets to assess model accuracy.
